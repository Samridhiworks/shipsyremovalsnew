        <h2>Part Truckload Freight</h2>

        <p>In PTL shipping, two or more companies share the truck load and accordingly pay for the logistics cost. The
          transportation chargesare shared amongst shippers and each shipper only pays for the space occupied by them.
          PTL pricing strategy is designed to cater to businesses that don’t often have truck full load to transport or
          those businesses</p>

        <h2>Full Truckload Freight</h2>

        <p>Full Truckload (FTL) refers to the shipment of goods that require the full capacity of a truck or trailer.
          FTL transportation is ideal for high-volume loads. It is used across industries, whenever large quantities of
          goods need to be consolidated and transported efficiently.</p>
